一个插件，集成 [lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/) 搜索引擎，给 TiddlyWiki 更复杂的搜索功能:

{{!!url}}

> Provides an alternative search result list that orders results by search relevance and ignores differences in word forms (ex. _tag_ vs _tags_).
> 
> On my personal wiki, I have the problem that there are terms I use across a lot of tiddlers, and sometimes I'll use different forms (such as the aforementioned _tag_ vs _tags_).  I wanted a plugin to allow me to find the tiddler I'm looking for quickly and didn't require me to worry about how I declined a noun or inflected a verb - so I wrote this plugin, which provides an alternative search list powered by [lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/).
