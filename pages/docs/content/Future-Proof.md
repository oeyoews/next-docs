摘录自 2016 年 01 月的[网络世界](http://www.networkworld.com/article/3028098/open-source-tools/tiddlywiki-a-free-open-source-wiki-revisited.html)杂志：

> Way back in the mists of time (actually, January 2009) I [wrote](http://www.networkworld.com/article/2272104/applications/an-amazing-free-microwiki.html) about a really cool tool called TiddlyWiki, a “non-linear personal web notebook”. Fast forward to today and I just had an out of body experience: Completely by accident I found a TiddlyWiki that I started when I wrote that piece and it still works!

> Finding code that works flawlessly after just two or three years is magical enough but after seven years?! And given that TiddlyWiki is written as a single page Web application and considering how different browsers are now than they were in 2009, the fact that the old version of TiddlyWiki still works is not short of miraculous.

TiddlyWiki 旨在与铭记其用户的长期需求。因为它是开放源码，且无需基础设施，我们可以确信，即使在遥远的未来，所有我们需要访问 ~TiddlyWiki 文件的只是一个普通的 HTML 浏览器。如果在您的职业生涯开始时使用 ~TiddlyWiki，您可以确信它将带您直到退休。
